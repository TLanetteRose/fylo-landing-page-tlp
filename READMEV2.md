# Project: Fylo Landing Page with Dark theme and Features Grid 

![Design preview for the Fylo landing page with dark theme and features grid challenge](../images/design-preview.jpg)

## Background
The Fylo Landing Page was completed using CSS Grid and Flexbox. It is a mobile-first design. I've also included a responsive navigation bar using CSS Grid, Flexbox, and JavaScript. 

The challenge included a style guide with specifications for font-size, colors, font families, and text for the web page. Images were also provided for the mobile and desktop previews.
